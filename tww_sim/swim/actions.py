"""Action-sequence helpers shared by the sim, planner, tests, and harness.

An *action* is one of ``ess`` / ``neu`` / ``chg`` (one game frame each). A *seq string* is the
compact run-length form ``"ess,200;chg,2;neu,50"``. These helpers convert between actions, seq
strings, and the per-frame stick element list consumed by ``dolphin_mem.advanceseq`` /
``superswim_sim``. Kept Dolphin-free so the core package has no live dependency.

Previously these lived inside ``run_tests.py``; they were extracted here because ~30 scripts
import them. ``run_tests.py`` now re-imports from this module.
