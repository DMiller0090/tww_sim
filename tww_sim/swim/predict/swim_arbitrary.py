"""swim_arbitrary.py - bit-exact v/anim/air for ARBITRARY main-stick directions.

GAP 2 fix. The base SwimState prices the per-frame speed gain through the discrete
'ess'/'neu'/'chg' action token (stick_to_action only recognizes sx==128). For random
main-stick directions (sx != 128) that token mis-classifies the frame and v diverges.

The TRUE per-frame gain is the SAME for every swim-input frame (setSpeedAndAngleSwim,
d_a_player_swim.inc ~27-41): there is NO chg/ess distinction in the game -- each frame
with stick deflection computes

    m34E8  = mMainStickAngle(sx,sy) + 0x8000 + camAngle           (s16)
    d_turn = snap to m34E8 if |m34E8 - facing| > 0x6000           (DIR_BACKWARD cone)
             else cLib gradual chase toward m34E8 (cap ARROW_TURN_RATE)
    gain   = mStickDistance * 3 * cM_scos(d_turn)                 (mStickDistance via /54 gate)

and applies it to potential_speed with a 1-frame lag (the gain computed on frame f lands
on frame f+1, replacing that frame's own gain). The facing snap/turn also lands next frame.

This subclass keeps EVERYTHING ELSE from SwimState (cold-start scramble via ColdStartSwimState,
anim advance, air, neutral physics, the state 54<->55 transition lag). It only replaces the
token-driven gain with the actual-stick gain, by driving the base machinery through a thin
shim: we pass the real (sx,sy) each frame and let _swim_facing / _chg_stick read it.

USAGE (drop-in for ColdStartSwimState in swim_predict_full):
    s = ArbitrarySwimState(v=v0, anim=anim0, air=air0, mrate=mrate0)
    s.state = st0; s._entry_tax = False; s.cam = cam0; s.facing = facing0
    for (sx, sy) in mainsticks:
        s.set_stick(sx, sy)
        d, tag = s.step(s.action_for(sx, sy))
