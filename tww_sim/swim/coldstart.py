"""swim_coldstart.py - bit-exact COLD-START scramble for the superswim sim.

Imports superswim_sim READ-ONLY (does NOT modify it). A SwimState subclass that fixes the
ONE cold-start inaccuracy: the base sim assumes the swim-initiation scramble oldframe is
`f32(self.anim + 1.0)`, which is slate-phase-dependent and WRONG at the current slate.

THE VALIDATED RULE (live-pinned on slot 10, 3 cold-starts, err +0.00000 each):
  The cold start has exactly ONE state-54 entry-tax frame on the charge input, then the
  state 54->55 scramble frame. The scramble oldframe is:

      oldframe = f32( f32(anim_seed + mRate_seed) + neutral_anim_rate(air_seed - 1) )
      scramble_anim = f32( f32(oldframe * 26.0) * 23.0 )

  - advance1 (entry-tax frame): display advances by the LOGGED controller rate `mRate`
    (read live @ move0_mrate = anim-chain base 0x803AD860 +0x2F60). This rate carries
    pre-seed AIR HISTORY (e.g. mRate 0.547222 at air-written 900 reflects air~882) and
    CANNOT be recomputed from air -> it must be LOGGED at the seed.
  - advance2 (scramble frame): neutral_anim_rate(air_seed - 1). This IS computable (the air
    decremented by the entry-tax frame) -> no logging needed.

  The base sim's f32(anim_seed + 1.0) gives oldframe 9.9417 vs the true 9.98892 ->
  scramble 5945.14 vs live 5973.37 (err -28), x598-amplified into the run_tests anim fails.

USAGE:
    from swim_coldstart import ColdStartSwimState
    s = ColdStartSwimState(v=v0, anim=anim0, air=air0, mrate=mrate0)  # mrate0 read LIVE
    s.state = st0; s._entry_tax = False
    for a in actions: s.step(a)
