"""NeckLook: Link's head-look twist ``m3564`` (``setNeckAngle``, d_a_player_main.cpp:8938-9169).

The last named courtyard model gap (harness/tetrapush README, planner box): ``jointBeforeCB``
twists Link's HEAD joint (CL_JNT_HEAD_JNT_e, 15) by ``local_38 = (m3564.y, m3564.z, m3564.x)``
(:269-270), and ``m3564`` chases a look target each execute frame in ``setNeckAngle`` (:11571 --
AFTER ``setMoveSlantAngle``, BEFORE ``mpCLModel->calc()``, so it reads the PREVIOUS frame's head
anm matrix and twists THIS frame's pose / ``mHeadTopPos``). Unmodeled it cost <=0.96 u of head-top
Y on the untarget-tier frames -> Tetra's elevation chase shifted -> a <=16-BAM facing echo on
Link's re-aim frames in the self-contained replay.

The per-frame law (the courtyard-reachable branches; everything s16-wrapping):

1. **Gate** (:9086): the chase runs toward a target only when the DISPATCH proc's mode flags
   (``mModeFlg``, set from the proc table at ``commonProcInit`` :5806) carry ``ModeFlg_00000080 |
   ModeFlg_08000000`` AND a look pos ``sp18`` was selected. MOVE/WAIT/ATN*/CUT* carry 0x80;
   FRONT_ROLL / MOVE_TURN / WAIT_TURN / SLIP do NOT -- which is exactly why ``m3564`` chases 0
   through every roll (live probe) even while the actor-lock is held mid-roll.
2. **Target selection** (:9014-9046): ``sp18 = eyePos`` of the locked actor (``mpAttnActorLockOn``)
   or, unlocked, of the attention's stocked lock-on-list head (``GetLockonList(0)`` via
   ``checkAttentionPosAngle``) -- both gated on the SAME +-0x6000 cone of ``m34DE`` (:9014/:8927,
   ``cLib_distanceAngleS(cLib_targetAngleY(current.pos, eyePos), m34DE)``). The list is why the
   chase continues on the post-drop backslide frames: in state NONE ``stockAttention`` restocks it
   every attention Run, EXCEPT on the RELEASE->NONE transition Run itself, where ``freeAttention``
   has just cleared it (``AttentionLock.list_present`` models that timing -- the probe's f21
   chase-to-0 hole).
3. **Measure** (:9070-9083): off the PREV frame's head matrix M, ``spC4 = M*(11.25,0,0)`` (head
   centre), ``spAC = M*(11.25,18.75,0) - spC4`` (eye direction); ``r24_4 = atan2s(-spAC.y,
   absXZ(spAC)) - m3564.x`` (the anim's own pitch, twist removed), ``r25_3 = atan2s(spAC.x,
   spAC.z) - m34DE - m3564.y``.
4. **Target angles** (:9087-9102): ``spB8 = sp18 - spC4``; ``r27 = atan2s(-spB8.y, absXZ(spB8))``
   clamped [-10000, 8000]; ``r23_3 = atan2s(spB8.x, spB8.z) - m34DE`` (or ``m3564.y`` when
   ``absXZ(spB8) < 30``) clamped +-``YAW_CLAMP`` (HIO ``mShip.m.field_0x0`` = 14336).
5. **Half-angle chase targets** (:9103-9114, the ModeFlg_00000080 non-DASHKAZE branch):
   ``r4 = (r27 >> 1) - r24_4``, ``r23 = (r23_3 >> 1) - r25_3``. Gate failed -> ``r4 = r23 = 0``
   (the :9138 ``m34C3 == 1`` branch reads ``m34E2 >> 1`` -- 0 the whole courtyard window, probed).
6. **Chase** (:9157-9168): ``cLib_addCalcAngleS(&m3564.{x,y}, target, 3, 0x1000, 0x100)``; then the
   yaw overflow clamp (:9159-9165, keeps ``r25_3 + m3564.y`` inside +-YAW_CLAMP); ``m3564.z``
   chases 0 (never driven in this regime).

Live ground truth: ``fixtures/courtyard_m3564.json`` (single-stepped slot-2 probe, f0..f44 --
``_notes/tetrapush-m3564_probe.py``); the f0->f5 decay 1262->842->562->306->50->0 pins the
(3, 0x1000, 0x100) chase knobs bit-for-bit. Pure model, no Dolphin dependency; inert unless
stepped by a driver (the from-f0 replay / FreeRun wires it -- the land goldens never construct it).
