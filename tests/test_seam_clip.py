    characterization sweep -- ~9.7M bit-exact ``crr_pos_walls`` calls (61 directions x 160k offsets).
    The cost is intrinsic: ``off_step`` (5e-8) is deliberately finer than the seam's plane fan
    (~1.4e-7 here), and the module docstring makes "no gap found" trustworthy ONLY when the offset
    step is finer than the fan -- so the resolution cannot be coarsened without weakening the proof.

    an order of magnitude finer than that fan, finds NO clip: the two coplanar quads tile the wall,

    ~1-ULP-different plane still catches it. There is no angular divergence (unlike a real corner)
