"""Phase-T gate: the from-rest COUPLED solver's acceptance CORE + Tetra-placement axis.

Locks in what `harness/rollstab/solver_tetra.py` newly does, against the live golden
(`fixtures/hyrule_tetra_geo.json`, from the RAM capture `tests/golden/hyrule_seam_1727_ram.json`,
slot 3). The solver threads the seam with the from-rest APPROACH knobs (moving `old`, live-pending on
a minted flooded-Hyrule anchor); the piece gated HERE is the NOVEL, offline-exact core it stands on:

  * a behind-Link stationary Tetra whose EMERGENT push -- the SAME `co_move_pair` output
    `cc_stepper._cc_check` computes each frame (the Co overlap of Link's animated FRONT_ROLL centre
    with Tetra's cylinder) -- steers the coupled endpoint through the seam and reproduces the live
    golden `new` BIT-EXACT (0-ULP);
  * the Tetra placement is a 2D f32 knob, not a 1D distance: a COLINEAR-BEHIND Tetra (push along the
    roll facing F) does NOT clip -- the steer bearing (~235deg, ~11deg off F) decides it
    ([[tetra-push-model]] correction); a wrong-side (in-front) Tetra never clips (direction guard).

Pure-geometry + offline (no Dolphin, fast). The full per-frame CUT_F ordering (push consume -> m34C2
lunge -> CrrPos) is separately live-gated by `test_cc_rollstab.py`; this gates the solver's predictor.
