"""Gate the LIVE push-aside seam clip (session 22, the Phase-T north star).

Tetra stands from the START (``placed_step=0`` -- an initial condition, NO mid-run write); Link's
roll PLOWS her aside, and her CC push steers the roll-stab ``CUT_F`` lunge through the seam at the
flooded-Hyrule corner (-1727,-990). Delivered live by a clean DTM and reproduced BIT-EXACT.

The two facts this locks down (fixture ``fixtures/hyrule_pushaside_clip_live.json``):

1. Seeded at the DTM's ACTUAL roll entry (the calibrated-walk entry -- NOT the capture fixture's;
   they differ by ~0.004u, which on f32 dust is block-vs-clip), the coupled engine reproduces the
   live run and predicts ``genuine``.
2. The engine's cut endpoint ``new`` == the LIVE cut endpoint, bit-for-bit.

Offline (no Dolphin): the live per-frame log is replayed from the fixture.
