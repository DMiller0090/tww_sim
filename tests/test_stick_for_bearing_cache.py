"""`stick_for_bearing`'s memo returns what the uncached inverse returns -- everywhere it is asked.

The inverse falls into a byte-neighborhood scan of up to 529 clamped decodes when the octagon clamp
moves its analytic candidate (2.8 ms a call, measured), and `full_herd.junction_alphabet` re-asks the
same fixed bearing ladder once per node per generation. Memoising it is only safe because the
function is pure, so this gates purity the way it can actually fail: the cached result must equal a
FRESH computation over a sweep that spans both branches -- the analytic hit and the clamp search --
and at partial magnitudes as well as full.
