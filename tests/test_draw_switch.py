"""Gate the mid-walk SWORD PULL-OUT model (session 34), live-data 0-ULP.

The scanner's ROLL dispatch needs a SHEATHED anchor to draw the sword mid-walk (roll->cut requires
sword_drawn). The sim froze the foot anim set (WALK/DASH vs sword WALKS/DASHS) at FootSpeedF
construction, so it could not represent the draw. Decomp (d_a_player_main.cpp): getAnmData keys the
leg table off mEquipItem (12951), setMoveAnime re-fetches it every frame (12734), and procMove's
steady setBlendMoveAnime(-1.0f) (6229) passes i_morf<0 -> NO oldframe-morf. So the swap is an
INSTANTANEOUS, phase-preserved pose jump the frame mEquipItem flips to daPyItem_SWORD_e (3976).

Model: FootSpeedF.draw_sword() flips _walk/_dash base->sword; LandState(model_draw=True) auto-triggers
it DRAW_DELAY acted-frames after a B rising edge while walking sheathed.

Live capture (harness.rollstab.capture_draw -> fixtures/walk_draw.json): on land_flatwalk, a straight
UP walk drawn at the start (UP+B) then decelerated through the WALK<->DASH blend. mEquipItem flips 5
frames after the raw B feed. The DASHS legs differ from DASH, so the switch TIMING matters:
- the from-rest walk with the anim-set switch (auto model_draw=True) is 0-ULP vs live, and
- BOTH naive baselines DRIFT: never-draw (stays DASH) misses the post-draw decel frames; always-drawn
  (DASHS from frame 0) misses the pre-draw DASH accel frame.

Offline (no Dolphin): the live per-frame pos_z log is replayed from the fixture.
