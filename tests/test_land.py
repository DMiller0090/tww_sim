"""Offline regression for the LAND walk sim (superswim.land).

Guards the BIT-EXACT part of the first land increment -- mNormalSpeed (potential_speed) and
the FREE_WAIT->MOVE->WAIT state machine -- as a golden arc, without needing Dolphin. The
live sim-vs-live gate is tests/dolphin/run_land_tests.py::walk_run; this is its token-cheap
offline shadow (same walk seq, same anchor rest seed, values pinned from land_walk_gt.csv).

Pure offline. What is asserted tightly (nspeed/state) is decomp-faithful to the ULP; the
position/speedF is the calibrated foot-plant stand-in (checked only loosely at the endpoint,
matching the live test's +-3), so it is NOT pinned per-frame here.
