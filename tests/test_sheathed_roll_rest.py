"""From-rest regression for the SHEATHED roll-stab anchor (kaze r11; root-caused + fixed session 38).

The sheathed-roll milestone (session 35 wired the mid-walk draw into the ROLL solver) needs a
SHEATHED anchor at the kaze roll seam that is REST BIT-EXACT so a solved from-rest clip delivers
0-ULP (the acceptance is f32 dust; dead-end #28). Session 36 minted one
(`kaze_r11_rollstab_sheathed@twwgz`, equip-only change off idle13, `mEquipItem` 0x100).

ROOT CAUSE (session 38, corrects sessions 36 + 37): the walk-entry foot-FK is BIT-EXACT -- session
37's `f312`-toe-stream story was a measurement artifact (it compared a sim MOVE frame against a live
WAIT frame). The sole divergence was a ONE-FRAME walk-entry alignment: the sheathed anchor needs DTM
alignment noops=1, idle13 needs 2. This is NOT in-game -- it is the anchor savestate's emulator
SUB-FRAME CAPTURE PHASE. idle13 (legacy translate-lineage mint) was captured MID-FRAME, so its first
post-load frame is a pure no-op re-display (proven: it mutates zero game state) -> +1 alignment noop.
The sheathed anchor (mint_current, boundary capture -- the canonical phase, same as the future
live-RAM UI feed) has no such re-display -> noops=1. `mint.capture_rest` now DERIVES this per anchor
(advances-until-d-changes) into `seed['rest_noops']`; `rest.rest_state` reads it (legacy seeds default
REST_NOOPS=2, keeping their locked goldens bit-exact). See dead-end #30 (corrected) + #25/#28.

Ground truth: `fixtures/sheathed_walkentry_golden.json` -- jitter-proof, emulator-frame-tagged, raw
mFootData per row. Aligned by the deterministic d_frame clock (immune to run_dtm row-0 poll jitter).
Live golden -- NEVER edit the fixture to make the sim pass.
