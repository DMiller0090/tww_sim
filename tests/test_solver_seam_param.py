"""Solver `seam=` threading (session 46, generalization Phase 3).

`solver.run`/`base`/`search`/`start_family`/`fine_family`/`arc_family` no longer read a module-global
`geometry as G`; they take a per-seam `SeamGeo` (default None = the kaze r11 seam `geometry.SEAM`), so a
NEW enumerated seam solves via the same path. This is a pure refactor (no sim/physics change); it locks:

  1. the parameterized path reproduces the shipped seed-0 kaze hit BIT-EXACT, and the explicit
     `seam=geometry.SEAM` result is byte-identical to the default `seam=None` (the GATE for Phase 3);
  2. `seam` is genuinely honored -- a SeamGeo with a different camera yaw (=> a different roll facing
     `F`) makes `start_family(anchor, seam=other)` produce a DIFFERENT aim than the default. If the
     families had silently kept reading the module-global geometry, this would not move (guards against
     a reintroduced hardcode, [[no-overtuned-constants]]).

Recipe = the shipped kaze roll-stab hit (`_generated/rollstab_hits.json[0]`, the SAME constants
test_sheathed_roll_clip embeds; `_generated/` is gitignored so it is embedded, not read).
