"""WALK-stab seam-clip driver + solver scaffold (kaze r11, anchor kaze_r11_walkstab@twwgz).

GENERALIZED (session 48): the seam geometry + exact acceptance is the shared `seamgeo.SeamGeo`
(built from `fixtures/kaze_r11_walkstab_geo.json` + the anchor csangle), not private duplicates. The
acceptance functions below (`in_front`/`genuine_clip`/`perp_ray`/`fast_cut`) delegate to it. The
thrust facing F and the crawl-window center are DERIVED, not pasted: F = derive_F(bear_to_S) (a nearly
flat seam grazes toward S, not into the corner bisector; == the shipped 5625), and `solve_focused`'s
`cruise_beta` defaults to bear_to_S (was the pasted 5556).

The walk stab is the roll stab WITHOUT the roll: walk up to a sub-cap speed, then thrust (fwd stick
+ B) so a CUT_F fires out of a MOVE. lunge = speedF + 23.220 (the CUT_F joint-0 root translate; KB
mechanics/walk-stab.md), so a capped walk (speedF 17) reaches disp 40.22. The kaze r11 slot-3 seam
S=(9030.955,1385.858) (poly 803 x 802, interior 168.97 deg) clips from disp >= 35.02 (min speedF
~11.8), so no roll is needed.

WHAT IS PROVEN (live-gated):
  * ACCEPTANCE STRUCTURE (harness.collision.gap_search.characterize on this seam): a perp RAZOR --
    the offset window is ~2e-4u -- with a WIDE aim window (+-40 deg) and a wide displacement window
    (disp 35.5-40 all clip). So the razor is the perpendicular offset `rho` (the cut ray's distance
    to S); aim and disp are forgiving.
  * FROM-REST is BIT-EXACT 0-ULP (position + facing) under the C-DOWN camera pin (`substickY=0`; the
    auto-cam would otherwise swing csangle and drift facing -- session 28). The session-29/30 "walk-
    entry foot toe-stream residual" was NOT a foot-FK gap -- it was `rest.rest_state` picking the wrong
    ANIM SET (sword-drawn WALKS/DASHS for a Wind-Waker anchor; fixed session 31, seeds `sword_drawn`
    from the anchor equip). So any genuine OFFLINE clip is a TRUE one-shot -- no residual to eat the
    razor. Live regression: tests/test_walkstab_rest.py.
  * THE CLIP IS DELIVERED LIVE, 0-ULP (session 32): tests/golden/walkstab_deliver.json.

DRIVER: walk N frames from the rest seed (C-down held), then enter_cut(CUT_F). The item put-away
delay is 4 frames of continued walking (the equip anime is upper-body; KB walk-stab.md), so the sim
is just walk-N-then-cut and the B-press is delivered at frame N-5 (4-frame put-away + 1-frame DTM
buffering -> CUT_F at frame N). The B-timing sets where `old` lands; time it to fire at the target
`old` before any wall decel (the search's wall-faithful gate enforces speedF still 17 at the cut).

SOLVER (`solve_focused()`, session 32): the objective-compliant one-shot -- the freeze-solver pattern
(cheap monotone predictor + bracket + exact bit-confirm), pure sim, no calibration. The acceptance perp
razor (~2e-4u) is a GAP in the reachable-old byte lattice at K<=2 crawls (min|perp| floors ~1.3e-3u,
~13x the razor -- which is why the old `solve()`, CRAWLS K<=2 + a collapsing arc/fine nudge, finds 0).
The fix: a K=3 START CRAWL densifies the perp lattice ~20x per frame (K=1 ~0.03u -> K=2 ~1.3e-3u ->
K=3 ~2e-5u), reaching the razor. Phase A brackets |perp_ray| coarsely (no CrrPos); Phase B drills a
byte-NUDGED 3rd crawl frame (octagon INTERIOR = the fine perp fill; the full-mag arc/cruise octagon-
CLAMP and collapse -- that collapse is why the old knobs failed); Phase C re-sims WITH walls and
accepts only wall_hit==False cuts (rejecting the dead-end #28 wall-overshoot artifacts). It finds
wall-faithful genuine hits in < 2 min. (`solve()` is kept as `solve_legacy` for the record.)

DELIVERY IS LIVE + 0-ULP (session 32) -- retires dead-end #28's "the walk-entry foot residual eats the
razor" premise (that was the sword/equip anim-set bug, fixed session 31; the from-rest walk is now
0-ULP, so any genuine offline clip is a true one-shot). `deliver()` shipped the top `solve_focused` hit
as a clean DTM (C-down every frame, B at frame N-5, NEVER advancewith): the CUT_F fired at N=13 with
`old`/`new` BIT-FOR-BIT the sim's from-rest prediction, the clip is genuine, and Link went OOB (proc
0x24, pos_y below the floor) THROUGH the seam. Live golden: tests/golden/walkstab_deliver.json;
regression tests/test_walkstab_clip.py.
