"""Out-of-the-box seam-clip checker: given a REGION (or a single seam), answer "is there a
clippable seam here, and what are the EXACT coordinates that perform the clip?" — accurately, with
NO parameters to get wrong, and fast (region scans complete in seconds, not minutes).

Scope (per the user's redirect): we do **not** compute the minimum-displacement clip for a seam
(that is :func:`gap_search.min_f32_clip`, an O(box²) lattice sweep). We only need to know a clip
**exists** and hand back one exact, physically valid ``(old, new)`` pair that performs it.

Hard requirements enforced here (all decided from the static DZB geometry — NOT from where Link
currently is, so the scan is Dolphin-free and its region is independent of Link):

  * **Existence, not minimum.** The reliable detector is the f32 lattice (:func:`first_f32_clip`):
    Link's position is f32, so only f32-representable ``new`` can clip. We ring-search out from a gap
    centre and return the FIRST clip (early-exit). A two-phase direction search finds it: a near-bisector
    sweep (symmetric corners) then, if empty, a screen-bracketed OBLIQUE band (asymmetric corners — the
    clip window skews fully off the bisector). The continuous screen only brackets where to look; it is
    anti-aligned with the exact f32 clip so it can't pinpoint it (see knowledge/mechanics/seam-clip.md).
  * **Standable, physically valid ``old``.** The returned initial position must be somewhere Link can
    actually stand: a DZB **ground** triangle under its XZ (:func:`seam_scan.floor_ys_at` — not Link's
    Y, not the wall base), the wall must reach that floor height, and ``old`` must be a WallCorrect
    fixed point against the FULL near-wall set (not embedded in / pushed out of any surrounding wall)
    and in front of both incident walls. ``require_standable=False`` (or ``override_link_y=``) skips
    the floor requirement for synthetic geometry (e.g. the self-test).

Self-test (reproduces the known GanonL grand-staircase clip, no hand params):
    python -m harness.collision.seam_clip_check --selftest
Region scan (live from a running Dolphin; needs the stage loaded):
    python -m harness.collision.seam_clip_check box=xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax
