"""Analytic seam-clip locator — the fast, COMPLETE rebuild of :mod:`seam_clip_check`.

Motivation (2026-07-08 research, handoff ``_notes/handoff-2026-07-08c-analytic-locator.md``): the
FIRST-EXPERIMENT finding is that the cheap prune ``{cone ∧ floor ∧ valid-old ∧ not-blocked}`` is a
SOUND SUPERSET of the real f32-clip set (it never drops a real clip) but is NOT tight — for
isolated / barrier-free corners it passes the WHOLE cone, so the final f32 verify is LOAD-BEARING,
not optional. The residual is genuine f32-razor loss (measured: FN0/FN1 have zero barriers and a
flat floor, yet f32 clips land only in a narrow sub-band), and it scales with coordinate magnitude
(local ULP vs the ~1e-3 fan gap).

The key STRUCTURE (KB ``mechanics/seam-clip.md``): a clip is a LINE property — for a fixed travel
direction the LineCheck-miss window is a thin interval in the line's PERPENDICULAR offset ρ from the
seam vertex S (fan-width, ~1e-3 u), but it extends broadly ALONG the travel direction. The old
square-ULP ring search failed exactly because it conflated the two axes (too thin perpendicular at
high coord when the box was small; wrong along-track centre per ``tf``). This locator searches
ANISOTROPICALLY instead:

  * per hot-spot-ordered cone direction (bisector + edges are the hot spots), settle one valid,
    standable **deep** old (oblique approaches settle far back — floor+~8..20 — which was the earlier
    miss root-cause);
  * VERIFY along-track ``s`` in coarse WORLD steps (wide, catches the right distance past S) × a THIN
    f32 box perpendicular (fine — the clip sits within a few ULPs of the through-S line), using the
    FULL trilist (barriers included, so barriers are handled by the verify, not a separate — and
    unsound — direction-level block prune); first ``crr_pos`` clip → done;
  * RE-VERIFY the winning exact ``old``->``new`` against the WHOLE room's walls (``locate``). The
    per-seam barrier is gathered by edge-distance ``GATHER_R`` around S at LINK'S floor Y, but it can
    still MISS a wall that blocks the swept clip — most sharply on a TALL corner where the standable
    floor sits hundreds of u above the seam-vertex Y (GanonK top-of-room), or a busy side corner
    (A_mori). A clip whose full-room sweep is stopped short (line/wall hit) is a phantom and dropped.
    Far walls can't touch the short cut segment, so this never false-NEGATIVES a real clip.

Both differing-normal corners AND single-normal COPLANAR flat-wall seams are searched (``enumerate_seams``
emits both; the line threads the f32 gap where two coplanar wall tris meet — A_mori (4077.6,-1708.8) is
a live-confirmed flat-wall clip). Nothing in the acceptance keys off the corner type.

Cheap rejection (fast, no f32 ring) comes from the standable-floor / valid-old gates: most genuinely
unclippable seams have no standable floor next to them and are dropped instantly. A per-seam f32
budget bounds the residual worst case (an isolated corner that cheap-passes the whole cone but whose
f32 gap is sub-ULP everywhere, e.g. the Hyrule 90° corners).

Result vs the committed :func:`seam_clip_check.scan_region` on Hyrule room 0 (190 seams): 106 s vs
680 s, and a strict SUPERSET — all 34 of the old scanner's clips PLUS 18 more (real, confirmed by
:func:`gap_search.min_f32_clip`; the old scanner missed them to its shallow-first, small-budget
search). KNOWN LIMITS: (1) the hardest unclippable corners (int≈90, cheap-pass-wide + sub-ULP gap)
still take ~2–5 s each to confirm — a native (Cython) port of the ``first_f32_clip`` ring is the
next lever for a hard per-seam <1 s; (2) ``disp`` is deep-first, so it is an UPPER bound, not the
minimum — use the analytic floor ``disp_floor(interior)`` for the reachability question (a clip is
roll-stab-reachable iff ``interior > 90.63°`` ⟺ ``floor ≤ 49.22``).
