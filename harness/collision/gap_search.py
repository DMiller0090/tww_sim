"""Analytic seam-clip gap search — the reliable replacement for the brute-force
``start x aim x D`` grid in :mod:`angle_experiment`.

**Why a grid fails.** A seam clip is a razor event: the swept centre-line must pass within a
*fan-sized* perpendicular offset of the seam vertex ``S`` — the offset window is only
~1e-3 u wide (its width IS the per-triangle plane fan, the 1-ULP normal difference between the two
triangles of each wall; see ``knowledge/mechanics/seam-clip.md``). A blind grid over start position,
aim and displacement steps far coarser than that window and reports spurious ``False`` at razor
angles (the old grid missed exactly-90.0 and 120.0, which DO clip).

**The analytic reduction.** The clip is decided by two independent conditions:

  1. **LineCheck miss** — the line's crossing with plane A and its crossing with plane B must each
     land just *past* the seam vertex (outside their own triangle's ``incl_box2d``). This happens
     iff the line passes within the fan offset of ``S``. So we do NOT search start-position freely:
     we **pin the line through S** (offset ``rho`` ~ 0) and only micro-scan ``rho`` at fan
     resolution. The travel *direction* has a broad window and the *displacement* ``D`` an even
     broader one (~35 up to ~95), so those are swept coarsely.
  2. **WallCorrect miss + a settled old** — both ends must clear the radius-35 wall cylinder. The
     endpoint clears cheaply (once ``new`` is behind the wall face, WallCorrect's directional test
     lets it pass, so it needs only a hair past ``S``). The DOMINANT term is the *old* position:
     ``old_pos`` must be a settled WallCorrect fixed point (the game never carries an old_pos inside
     the cylinder), so it sits ``~wall_r / sin(halfangle)`` in front — e.g. 37.6 u for the GanonL
     137-deg corner (``35/sin(68.5)``), ~35 u for a right-angle corner approached off the bisector.
     That front clearance sets the **min-speed** (geometry-dependent, ~35-38 u, NOT a flat 35).

Feeding the exact bit-exact FP model (:func:`tww_sim.core.collision.crr_pos_walls`) at the pinned
offsets makes "gap found" reliable and cheap. "No gap found" is only trustworthy when the offset
step is finer than the fan (see :func:`fan_offset_scale` and ``off_step`` — the default is fine
enough for real corners; for near-flat seams pass a smaller ``off_step``).

**f32-HONESTY (do NOT remove).** Link's position is stored as f32 (``cXyz`` = three f32;
``pm_pos``/``pm_old_pos`` are ``cXyz*``, ``d_bg_s_acch.h``), and ``core.fp`` is only console-faithful
when fed f32 (see its docstring). So every candidate ``old``/``new`` is snapped to f32 (:func:`_p32`)
before the model runs. This is not cosmetic: a blind double-precision search reports **false-positive**
clips at sub-ULP offsets the game can never occupy. Measured at the live (-1727,-990) seam: a
rel=-14deg direction has 9 "clips" over a 0.04u rho span in double precision but **0** survive f32
rounding, whereas the genuine clip zone (rel~+45deg) survives f32 (2571 vs 2573 of 20001 samples).
The continuous/double "gap window" is therefore only an upper bound — practical viability is decided
by whether an f32-representable position lands in it (``knowledge/mechanics/seam-clip.md``).

Geometry-agnostic: pass the 4 wall triangles (``tris[1]`` = wall-A seam triangle, ``tris[2]`` =
wall-B seam triangle — the convention :func:`angle_experiment.build_angle` and the GanonL
``seam_model`` both use) plus the seam XZ point and Link's floor Y.
