"""Generalized, pipe-artifact-free DTM runner.

Give it a per-frame INPUT sequence (raw sticks, or an ess/chg/neu action list) and an
optional EXPECTED endpoint; it handles the rest: author a clean-cadence DTM, copy the
savestate anchor, (re)launch Dolphin to a stopped game list, play the movie, read the
live endpoint, and compare. This is the trustworthy live check (movie playback flips
WantDeterminism on and polls at the game's natural cadence -- no advanceseq pipe jitter,
see pt-21 / KNOWLEDGE bug#2). Dolphin command reference: ../../tools/DOLPHIN_CONTROL.md.

Generalizes harness/validate/validate_dtm.py, which was hardwired to action-seq files, the
cold anchor, and a SwimState compare. Here:
  - inputs are universal per-frame sticks (action lists convert via actions.acts_to_seq),
  - the anchor / template / expected are all parameters,
  - boot is detected by an anchor-loaded readiness predicate (state-agnostic: swim slate 54/55,
    land idle 5, ...), NOT the movie playing flag (true from the playmovie call all through boot,
    so it can't tell us the anchor is in -- resuming before it wastes the input frames on a
    still-booting game), and
  - the end state is read once the movie exhausts and the emulator pauses at the last frame
    (PauseMovie, ensured by dolphin_env) -- exact and fast, no per-frame pipe stepping.

Works for ANY player state, one playback path with all the gotchas: pass a `ready` predicate and
put the state's fields in `expected`. swim_ready / land_ready are provided; land also reads/compares
pos_x/pos_z and the two-angle model (shape/travel). The swim defaults are unchanged.

Programmatic:
    from harness.dtm.run_dtm import run_dtm, sticks_from_actions, land_ready, land_walk_sticks
    end = run_dtm(sticks, expected={'v': -812.3, 'anim': 4.1, 'air': 870, 'state': 55},

    end = run_dtm(land_walk_sticks(30, 15), expected={'pos_z': 1095.42, 'state': 5},
