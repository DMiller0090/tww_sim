# The draw base - WHERE and WHEN the model is posed

**Answers:** Which position does Link's model calc run from - the one at the start of the frame or
after `posMove` has moved him? Does the MOVE turn lean (`shape_angle.z`) go into the base? Why does a
proc `*_init` frame pose differently? Why does any of this matter when the base is cancelled out
again?
**Status:** validated live 0-ULP (2026-07-28): every model-local x/z of the console's `mFootData`
toes/heels matches at the sampled frames (`tests/test_foot_draw_base.py` over
`fixtures/courtyard_node1_foot_s57.json`), and the Courtyard plan's anim-driven frames went from
12-1159 ULP off to exact (`tests/test_node1_console.py` n=72..77).
**Source:** decomp `d_a_player_main.cpp` `setWorldMatrix` (:9559-9575, called :11551) +
`commonProcInit` (:5841); sim `tww_sim/core/anim/foot_speedf.py` (`defer_draw`/`finish_draw`) +
`tww_sim/land/state.py` (the frame-end block) + `tww_sim/core/anim/fk.py` (`world_base`).

---

There is ONE `mpCLModel->calc()` per frame, and everything pose-shaped reads it: the foot toe stream
[posMoveFromFootPos](anim-engine.md#toe--speedf) consumes, the `setCollision` root/neck midpoint that
becomes the [Co-cylinder centre](../mechanics/actor-push.md), Link's `mHeadTopPos`. So they all share
one base matrix, and the base has three parts.

## Position: AFTER posMove, not before

`setWorldMatrix` builds `worldBase = transS(current.pos) . ZXYrotM(shape_angle)` late in `execute`,
after `posMove` has already integrated the frame's motion. The pose the game hands to the NEXT
frame's `posMoveFromFootPos` is therefore taken at the END-of-frame position - which is also why the
toe stream runs one frame behind (`t1` = last frame's draw, `t2` = the one before).

In the sim this is `FootSpeedF.defer_draw`: the compose reads only `t1`/`t2`, so `speedF` is exact
before the draw; the pose is stashed and `finish_draw()` lands it once `LandState.step` has moved
Link. A pre-integration draw is a different (wrong) base.

## Lean: `shape_angle.z`, except on a proc-init frame

`ZXYrotM` concats the Z rotation, so the MOVE turn lean (`m351C >> 1`, see
[ground-turns](../mechanics/ground-turns.md)) tilts the base. The exception is a frame on which a proc
`*_init` ran: `commonProcInit` zeroes `shape_angle.z` BEFORE `setWorldMatrix`, and `setMoveSlantAngle`
only restores it afterwards, so that frame draws upright. "A proc init ran" = the post-step proc
differs from the frame-START proc (capture it before the A-roll trigger, which would mask a roll
entry). Same rule, same frame, for the Co-centre - they are the same calc.

## Why ULPs of base matter

The base is removed again by `m37B4` (`PSMTXInverse(worldBase)`), so in exact arithmetic none of this
would move the model-local pose at all. It is not exact arithmetic: the FK accumulates at WORLD
magnitude, so each joint matrix is quantized to the f32 spacing there - 1.22e-4 u at |x| ~ 1600 -
and the cancellation cannot undo that. See [anim-engine](anim-engine.md#foot-fk-runs-in-world-space).

That granularity is the whole error budget of `f31_2`, the plant-toe delta: a walk step's delta is a
few units, so ONE world ULP in a toe component is a ~1e-4 u error in `speedF`. It is invisible while
`m3598 == 0` (momentum owns the speed and the stream is only warmed), and it is the position the
moment the walk anim owns the speed. Getting the base wrong cost the Courtyard plan 32-128 ULP per
toe component and 1-1159 ULP of Link position on the first anim-driven frames.
