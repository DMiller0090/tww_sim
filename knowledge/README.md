# tww_sim knowledge base

The retrieval-first knowledge base for TWW player physics - **superswimming** (swim) and **land**
movement - plus strategy, the shared engine, and the sim/planner model. **Start here** - find your
question below, follow the link, read one small page.

## How this is organized

Knowledge is split by **layer** - different kinds of fact with different lifespans:

| Layer | What | Lifespan |
|-------|------|----------|
| [`mechanics/`](mechanics/) | Game truth - formulas, constants, decomp-grounded behavior | timeless |
| [`strategy/`](strategy/) | TAS heuristics - reboost, dips, phase ordering | evolves |
| [`model/`](model/) | How the sim/planner implements it - engine (FP, anim), swim, land | tracks code |
| [`reference/`](reference/) | [Constants](reference/constants.md), [addresses](reference/addresses.md), [glossary](reference/glossary.md), [commands](reference/commands.md), [data](reference/data.md) | lookup |
| [`history/`](history/) | Provenance, dead ends, superseded conclusions, open questions | frozen |

**`history/` is not current truth** - its pages carry a `status: historical` banner. When you grep
for an answer, prefer the mechanics/strategy/model/reference pages; only read history for "how did we
get here" or provenance. Every page opens with an **`Answers:` / `Status:` / `Source:`** header so
you can triage in one glance.

Keep pages **small and single-topic** (one Read should answer the question). Put dated narrative and
superseded findings in `history/`, not in the truth pages. One canonical value per constant - link
to [constants.md](reference/constants.md) instead of restating numbers.

If a topic has an **unresolved verdict**, give it a short `## Open question - <current status>`
section *in the truth page* (state the current best answer + "unproven"), and link to `history/` for
the provenance. The definitive *current* answer must be reachable from the truth layer - not only
from a `status: historical` page. (Validated by the doc-eval: weak agents were told to prefer
non-history pages, so an answer that lives only in history is effectively hidden.)

The KB is regression-tested by a bounded weak-agent eval - the question bank + run protocol under
[`_eval/`](_eval/) (Tier-A retrieval / Tier-B comprehension, run by fanning out weak sub-agents;
agents must never read `_eval/` itself, the answer key).
