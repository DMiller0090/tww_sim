# The 1-frame turnaround out of an EBS - and why the camera cannot set it up

**Answers:** How does the instant 1-frame facing snap out of an extended brakeslide work? What decides
whether it fires? Can the camera (csangle) be steered to make it fire? Why does a probe that COMMANDS a
csangle find a snap window that no real plan can ever reach?
**Status:** validated - the snap itself is simulated bit-exact in
[`tww_sim.land`](../../tww_sim/land/land.py) and used by
[`harness/tetrapush/reposition.py`](../../harness/tetrapush/reposition.py) `turnaround`; the camera
unreachability is measured over 330 reachable camera states of 3 real planner arrivals (2026-07-31) and
gated.
**Source:** decomp `d_a_player_main.cpp` facing chase (`cLib_addCalcAngleS`) + the
`temp * temp2 <= 0` cross-travel branch; live courtyard captures. The measurement is
[`harness/tetrapush/away_walk.py`](../../harness/tetrapush/away_walk.py) `snap_reach` / `snaps_at`,
gated in [`tests/test_away_walk.py`](../../tests/test_away_walk.py).

## What it is

In the untarget [EBS](brakeslide-ebs.md) facing sits ~exactly `0x8000` from travel (he slides
backwards). Holding [ESS](ess.md)-down `(128,110)` for ONE frame at the right `csangle` sets the stick
want-angle so the facing chase **steps across travel** in a single frame: `temp * temp2 <= 0` →
`facing = travel`, a ~180 deg snap with the **speed preserved** (`cos(target - travel) ≈ 1`, the
-25.727 backslide held). Off that window you get a `MOVE_TURN` reversal instead
([ground-turns.md](ground-turns.md)), which costs the speed.

This is the land counterpart of the swim charge snap ([turnaround.md](turnaround.md)) and a different
mechanism: the swim snap is `getDirectionFromAngle(stick vs FACING)`, this one is the facing chase
crossing **TRAVEL**.

## The quantity that decides it is `want - travel`, not `want - facing`

The stick is camera-relative, so its world want-angle is `m34E8 = stick_angle + 0x8000 + csangle`
([turnaround.md](turnaround.md#the-target-direction-term-m34e8)). The snap fires on where that lands
relative to **travel**, so the camera looks like a free knob: rotate csangle, rotate the want-angle,
walk it into the window.

Measured on one fixed courtyard EBS state, commanding csangle across the circle at 512 BAM: the ESS
frame turns **30778 BAM (169 deg)** and snaps for `want - travel` in roughly `-6986..-2890`
(16-38 deg behind travel), and **6000 BAM (33 deg)** - no snap - one grid step outside it. A hard cliff
with a wide (~78-82 deg of csangle) window on one side of it.

## But the camera cannot deliver it, because travel chases the camera

That window is real and unreachable, and the trap is worth stating plainly because a commanded-csangle
probe cannot see it: **the post-roll EBS travel chases csangle**. So slewing the camera moves the stick
want-angle and the travel TOGETHER, and `want - travel` - the only quantity that matters - barely
moves.

Measured on 3 real planner arrivals, sweeping the previous roll's camera target over `+-0x4000` at step
64 (513 targets → 110 distinct reachable `(csangle, travel)` states each):

| | reachable (the roll actually slewed there) | commanded (same csangles, travel frozen) |
|---|---|---|
| states that SNAP | **0 / 0 / 1** of 110 | **10 / 9 / 9** of 110 |
| `want - travel` covered | -21906..+6195 BAM, with a **15866 BAM (87 deg) HOLE** | continuous |

The hole is exactly where the snapping band sits. The travel chase pins `want - travel` near 0 across
the whole slew, then jumps it past the window when travel flips branch - so the window is skipped, not
approached. A camera bill priced at 29 deg inside a 56 deg slew span therefore reads payable and is
not.

**The rule this gives:** never price a facing-snap setup by commanding a csangle onto a state whose
travel was fixed by something else. Sweep the channel that would actually pay (here the previous roll's
C-stick) and read the states it delivers. Gated by
[`tests/test_away_walk.py`](../../tests/test_away_walk.py)`::test_the_camera_cannot_deliver_the_snap_because_travel_chases_it`,
which pins the CONTRAST - either half alone is misleading.

## Why the snap is wanted, and what else can do its job

The reason to snap at all is usually to get an actor OUT of the ±90 deg talk/lock cone before an L
input acts ([tetra-follow.md](tetra-follow.md)) - an L that acts with the actor in the cone targets it
instead of doing its job. The snap is the cleanest way to clear the cone in one frame, **not the only
one**: measured, an ESS frame that turns only `0x1425` (28.3 deg), well under a snap, still leaves a
working escape because the cone is cleared one frame later by the frame the L acts on. So test the
OUTCOME (did the L act with the actor out of cone) rather than the snap, or a sufficient condition gets
used as a necessary one and real states are discarded.
