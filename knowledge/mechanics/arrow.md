# Arrow swimming

**Answers:** What is arrow swimming? How much speed do you lose by tilting? What's the tilt
limit before it breaks? How does the cross-track drift scale? What is the arrow spin-up cost?
**Status:** validated (decomp + live, closed-form in `tww_sim/swim/predict/swim_arbitrary.py` /
`ArrowState`).
**Source:** decomp `setSpeedAndAngleSwim` (d_a_player_swim.inc:41,66); live 2026-06-27 (slot 9).

## What it is

Instead of charging straight back-and-forth, you **tilt the alternation axis toward the target**.
Link still snaps 180° each frame (see [turnaround](turnaround.md)), but now each pair of snaps
points slightly toward the destination, so he **drifts toward it while still building speed** —
forming the "tip of an arrow" pointing at the target. You trade charge rate for early progress.

## The closed-form model (parameterized by tilt α)

α = the move-direction offset from the pure-back axis toward the target. Each alternation rotates
facing by **(180° − 2α)**, and:

```
charge_rate(α) = −3 · dist · cos(2α)          # α=0 → −3 (pure back); falls as you tilt
cross_drift(α) = disp · sin(α)   per frame     # toward the target, ACCUMULATES every frame
along_move(α)  = disp · cos(α),  sign alternates (net ~cancels, like pure charge)
disp           = charge_disp_factor · true_disp(v, anim, air)
```

So tilting trades **charge rate (`cos 2α`)** for steady **cross-track drift (`sin α`)**.
`mStickDistance` stays capped at 1 — **tilt changes the cosine (the snap angle), not the
magnitude**. The decomp gain `delta = mStickDistance·3·cos(Δfacing)` is frame-exact.

### Live match

| Xbias | α | model charge rate | live |
|-------|---|-------------------|------|
| 128 | 0° | −3.00 | −3.00 |
| 160 | 8° | −2.88 | −2.88 |
| 180 | 18° | −2.43 | −2.44 |

`dz/|move| = sin α` to < 0.004. Earlier 12-frame sweep (alternating `(Xbias,255)/(Xbias,0)`):

| X-bias | off | charge rate | net disp | regime |
|--------|-----|-------------|----------|--------|
| 128–135 | ≤7 | −3.0/fr | ~0 | dead zone (no effect) |
| 145 | 17 | −3.0/fr | 44 | arrow onset |
| 160 | 32 | −2.90/fr (97%) | 387 | arrow charge |
| 180 | 52 | −2.52/fr (84%) | 845 | arrow charge (sweet spot) |
| 200 | 72 | +2.0/fr (LOSS) | 2290 | tipped into pure release |

## The usable range and tip-over

**Usable α ∈ [0°, ~20°]** (up to Xbias ≈ 180–190). Past that the two alternation targets fall
within 135° of each other, the backward snap dies (see [turnaround](turnaround.md#beyond-the-budget-gradual-turn)),
and the stick drives a **forward release** — speed LOSS with a large forward displacement. This is
the same **45° angular budget** as the turnaround snap, expressed as a stick tilt.

## Arrow spin-up cost (2 frames)

When the alternation begins, the first sticks are **< 135°** away from facing → they are **non-snap
forward frames** that each **lose ~+3/fr** before the 0↔180 swing locks in. Live-measured at **~2
frames**. A planner must charge this cost, or it will pick short arrow phases that never pay it off.

## Stick angle (why the dead zone matters)

The tilt the game reads is **not** raw `atan2(ax, −ay)` — a **per-axis dead zone of 15** (the same
constant as the [decay curve](../reference/constants.md#stick-geometry)) is removed first. That is
what makes a partial-Y arrow stick read the correct tilt: `(0,96)` → α ≈ 8° (raw atan2 would give
~14°). For an on-axis stick the closed form is exact; off-axis, the exact `mMainStickAngle` is read
from a live grid (`stick_angle_table.csv`) because Dolphin's byte→analog mapping diverges from the
closed form at the deadzone boundary and octagon. That table's `stick_dist`/`value` magnitude columns
**equal** the closed-form `/54` the gain already uses (see [model/predictors](../model/predictors.md#why-a-live-stick-angle-grid-not-a-closed-form)).

## 2-D geometry (the stepper)

`ArrowState` decodes the full 2-D mapping: `move_bearing = camAngle − facing` (a reflection;
`K = camAngle`). Stick→angle: `stickAngle = atan2(ax, −ay)` after the dead-zone-15, then
`m34E8 = stickAngle + 180 + camAngle`; snap iff `|angdiff(m34E8, facing)| > 135°`. The chain
reproduces facing to ≤ 0.6° and net drift bearing to ~1° live. `reorient_chain()` generalizes to
any start/target axis via a facing-BFS (it is not hardcoded — see
[turnaround: reorienting](turnaround.md#reorienting-the-charge-axis-turnaround-chains)).

> The state-54→55 **entry release** (the arrow↔cruise hand-off, live f1 −300→−24) is priced
> separately by the planner, not inside the stepper.

## Does arrow swimming save time? — NO (offline, exhaustive)

**Verdict: no.** An exhaustive offline insertion sweep (2026-07-02, 134 cells) inserted an arrow
phase at every point of a straight swim — deep build → build→cruise transition → into cruise —
across distances 100k/200k/400k/800k, arrow lengths 30–300, and all schedule shapes, comparing
total frames to the straight continuation from the *same* mid-swim state. **Every cell is a loss;
zero wins.** Best case is **+4 frames** (400k, deep-build insertion at v≈−1280, length 60); losses
grow **monotonically** the later/longer you arrow (transition ~+7–17, into cruise up to +32, long
arrows +45–89).

**Why:** cruising straight points the *whole* velocity at the target (ESS travels backward toward
it); arrowing spends most speed on the perpendicular alternation axis and only the `sin α` sliver
drifts toward target — so at any real cruise speed (v≈−300 to −1300) cruise's toward-target rate
strictly beats arrow's. Arrow only out-progresses cruise at v≈0 (cold, before cruise spins up), a
window too short to cover the reorient + [spin-up](#arrow-spin-up-cost-2-frames) overhead. This is
why the from-cold planner also picks `n_arrow=0` (arrow lost by 2–4 there even with lengths
searched to 300).

**Scope (what this does NOT rule out):** the sweep is offline, on the single default slate
geometry (target due-south, cam 270), with the α≤20° tip-over cap and the sim's charge/pump/ESS
action set. It does not cover off-slate geometries, arrow interacting with reboost/stroboscopic
phase, obstacle-forced detours where cross-drift is "free," or any regime the sim itself
mis-models. The claim is strong and mechanism-backed for the straight open-water swim, not a
universal proof. If a future route has a lateral offset the straight plan must pay for anyway,
re-test arrow there — that's the one shape the mechanism above could favor.

The only regime not yet live-validated is the **cold entry release** (v≈0, state 54→55,
[×598 scramble](../reference/glossary.md#x598)) — `ArrowState` is validated charged
(v≈−300..−1300), not through the cold entry. But that is arrow's *only* near-break-even case and
it still loses offline, and every high-v cell (validated regime) loses decisively, so a cold-start
DTM would be confirmation, not an open risk. Sweep data + full write-up:
