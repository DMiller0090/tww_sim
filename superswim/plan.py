superswim_plan.py - Unified-DP full-swim planner (skeleton).

ONE shortest-path / forward-DP search over the whole swim, replacing the stacked
per-phase optimizers in superswim_optimize.py. Phases are *transition functions*
on a shared SwimState (superswim_sim.py), NOT nested search loops: adding a phase
== adding actions, ~free. See HANDOFF.md "NEXT BIG ITEM" and SUPERSWIM_KNOWLEDGE.md
§5 for the agreed design.

WHY THIS IS A DAG (clean forward DP):
  `air` decreases by exactly 1 on every action (SwimState.step does `self.air -= 1`),
  so it is a monotone time axis. Layer t of the DP == all reachable states at
  air = air0 - t. No cycles, no negative edges -> a plain forward sweep, one layer
  per frame, is optimal. Because the whole layer shares the same air, `air` is NOT
  in the dominance key (sig()); only the within-layer physical state is.

DOMINANCE (the pruning that makes it tractable):
  Two states in the same layer with the same sig() (anim phase, potential speed,
  heading parity, and all the 54<->55 transition-lag fields) evolve identically
  forever. For min-frames-to-dest, among same-sig states the one with greater
  forward progress (-x) reaches the destination no later, so we keep only that one.
  sig() is reused verbatim from superswim_optimize so the skeleton can't silently
  diverge from the validated min-frames optimizer (see selfcheck below).

THE BLOWUP RISK IS x598, NOT PHASE COUNT (HANDOFF):
  The neutral->ESS pump scrambles the ESS-start anim through a x598 multiply
  (setSwimMoveAnime). Do NOT globally fine-grid `anim` to chase it. The scramble is
  DETERMINISTIC: SwimState already computes the exact landed anim for each pump, so
  a pump is just a discrete branch (the 'neu'->'ess' action sequence), not a search
  dimension. We keep anim coarse on smooth ESS/neutral stretches (sig() rounds anim
  to 0.03) and let the pump branches carry their own exact anim. Frontier size is
  instrumented per layer; if a layer exceeds `max_frontier`, we prune by forward
  progress and LOG it, so a blowup is visible rather than silent.

ACTIONS / PHASES (pluggable):
  CRUISE   = ess, chg     ESS cruise + reboost turnaround (state 55)
  ENDGAME  = neu          drag-free |v| neutral dash; also encodes the ESS->neutral
                          EXIT and the neutral->ESS PUMP via the 1-frame state lag in
                          SwimState. Keeping 'neu' in the set prices the exit-phase
                          penalty automatically (SUPERSWIM_KNOWLEDGE PLANNING PRINCIPLE:
                          the search holds ESS to a good exit phase when that beats
                          dashing immediately).
  FRONTEND = arrow*       charge / arrow-swim toward the target (cos-penalised charge,
                          45deg=0x2000 instant-turnaround snap). NOT YET ENABLED -
                          the sim models only a 1-D travel axis; arrow swimming needs
                          2-D heading + live validation first. See ARROW_TODO below.

Usage:
  py superswim_plan.py dest=D [v=-1630] [air=900] [anim=18.148]
                       [phases=cruise,endgame] [max_frontier=8000] [selfcheck=1]

FRONTEND is composed HIERARCHICALLY (the design's sanctioned escape hatch), NOT merged
into the per-frame cruise DP. Reason: arrow swimming needs 2-D position + facing, which
cannot be collapsed by sig() dominance (the documented x598/heading blowup). And it
NEED NOT be merged: arrow yields only disp*sin(alpha) progress/frame vs ESS's full disp,
so once speed is built it is never worth interleaving arrow back into cruise. The optimal
swim is therefore a strict PREFIX (charge/arrow + reorients) then a cruise/dash SUFFIX.
plan_with_frontend() searches the prefix (alpha-gear x arrow length), prices both
hand-off reorients via the facing-BFS (reorient_chain), and composes with the validated
plan_min_frames() cruise. Front-end per-frame physics are the live-validated arrow

# HIERARCHICAL pump planner (the design's sanctioned escape hatch) — CROSSOVER design.
#
# WHY the flat allow_pump DP is intractable: the x598 pump scramble lands a DISTINCT anim
# phase per pump entry, so the frontier saturates at max_frontier on EVERY layer and
# dominance cannot merge them (genuinely distinct futures — empirically confirmed 2026-06-27:
# coarsening sig()'s anim AND v buckets leaves the frontier pinned at 8000). So pumps cannot
# be priced by dominance; the flat pump DP just runs the saturated frontier for the WHOLE
# horizon (cold dest=100000: 511s, 388/396 layers capped) and is far too slow for 200k.
#
# KEY EMPIRICAL FACT that makes the decomposition work: pumps only pay off in the LOW-SPEED
# BUILD. At sustained cruise (v≈-1630) pumps save ZERO frames (measured: cruise dest=60000
# pump vs no-pump both 41 fr). The flat DP wastes its entire long-cruise horizon carrying a
# saturated pumped frontier for nothing. (Also empirically: greedily INSERTING pumps into the
# pump-free optimum never improves it — the gain needs co-designed charge+pump timing, not a
# perturbation. So insert-into-baseline is the WRONG decomposition; crossover is the right one.)
#
# CROSSOVER: run the expensive pumped DP ONLY over a short build distance `build_dist` (the
# low-speed regime where pumps live), then continue PUMP-FREE (fast, near-unsaturated) over
# the long cruise remainder. The build's whole arrival frontier is carried forward (a slightly
# slower build endpoint can carry a better cruise phase), screened with the pure-ESS surrogate,
# and only the top `refine` get the exact cruise DP. Bounded build horizon => bounded cost;
# pumps are still priced by the exact pumped DP where they matter.
